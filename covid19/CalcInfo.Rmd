### Calculation Information
*These reference the essential calculations used to conduct analysis and the assumptions made of the data*  

**Dynamic Elements**: 

1. **Local Counties**: Counties included in the analysis are determined using geospatial coordinates (Latitude, Longitude) and determining the mileage distance from the base to the center of a county. Counties are included if their central location lies within the specified radius. 

1. **Hospitals**: Hospitals are calculated using geospastial distance between the base and the hospital similar to local counties. Hospitals are included based on their mileage distance to the installation of interest. Furthermore, hospitals are filtered to only inlcude "General Care" and "Acute Care" as these are the primary types of hospitals to supply beds and ventilators to Covid-19 patients. 

**Case Statistics**: 

1. **Confirmed Cases**: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths are reported daily and summed by state state and local region, which is determined by the user. 

2. **Hospitalization Utilzation**: Hospitalization rates are a function of the total number of hospital beds in a county and the number of locally confirmed cases. The percentage of hospitalized patients totals the number of confirmed cases in the past 7 days (average length of hospital stay) and multiplies that number of cases by a percentage (15%) provided by the Center for Disease Control estimating the percentage of patients requiring a hospital stay. This number is then added to the national average hospital capacity. $Hospital Utilization=\frac{(\sum^n_{i=n-7}Cases_i)-(\sum^{n-8}_{i=1}Cases_i)}{TotalLocal Beds}*Hospitalization Rate+Average Utilization$.


3. **Percentage Change in Hospitalization Utilization**: The change in hospitalization rates is calculated by the the difference in new cases and the confirmed cases 8 days prior. With that difference, the change is then divided by the total number of hospital beds in the local area to calculate a percentage change in the local area.$ChangeHospital Utilization=\frac{(Cases_n)-(Cases_{n-8})}{TotalLocal Beds}*Hospitalization Rate$
